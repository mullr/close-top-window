# A FoundryVTT Module to fix the Escape key. 

In every computer since the dawn of time, pressing the escape key closes the currently active window. 
But not in Foundry! For some reason, there it closes /all/ the windows. This is a problem if, say, 
the normal behavior of the escape key has been hardcoded into your muscle memory by 30 years
of consistent behavior across literally every other piece of software. 

This module makes the Escpae key do what it's supposed to do: close the top-most window.
